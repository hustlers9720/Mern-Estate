MERN Estate
A full-stack real estate application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This project allows users to browse, search, and view real estate listings and includes features such as authentication, user-specific listings, and dynamic filtering. It uses Vite for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with MongoDB as the database.

Features
Frontend: React (using Vite for development) and Tailwind CSS for styling.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for the API and routing.
Database: MongoDB for storing listings and user data.
Authentication: Includes secure user authentication and authorization.
Search Functionality: Real-time filtering and searching for listings.
Contact Landlord: Allows users to contact landlords directly.
API Integration: Uses a secure API for accessing data.
Deployment: Supports deployment to production environments with build scripts.
